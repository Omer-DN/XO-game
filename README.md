# XO-game
The game is structured as follows:
Player vs player (human) option
Player versus computer option.
When in each turn, the player chooses a slot, and the algorithms check if the slot is free (and allowed).
When playing against the computer, the computer in turn will try to prevent the other player from winning or check the higher chance of winning for him
